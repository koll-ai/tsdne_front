            <h3> What is the SCP foundation ?</h3>
            <p>
                The SCP Foundation is an international secret society responsible for capturing and containing various paranormal,
                supernatural, and other mysterious phenomena unexplained by mainstream science (known as "anomalies" or "SCPs"),
                while also keeping their existence hidden from the rest of global human society.

                <br></br>
                <br></br>

                They include living beings and creatures, artifacts and objects, locations and places, abstract concepts,
                and incomprehensible entities which display supernatural abilities or other extremely unusual properties.
                If left uncontained, many of the more dangerous anomalies will pose a serious threat to humans or even all life on Earth.

                <br></br>
                <br></br>

                The SCP are divided in different classes depending on its containment difficulty. There are many classes but
                we're limiting them to:

            <h3> How are the SCP generated ? </h3>
            <p>
                The SCPs are generated using GPT-4 by <a href="https://openai.com">OpenAI</a>. The Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4
                (GPT-4) is an autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. GPT-4's full version has a capacity of 175
                billion machine learning parameters. The quality of the text generated by GPT-4 is so high that it can be difficult to determine whether or
                not it was written by a human
